# Crime-Data-Inquiry-Display
Final Project for a computer Science course. 
Project loads in a given set of data (in this case FBI crime scene data over the last five years) and allows the user to run a series of searches on the data. After inputing a search term the program requests follow up input based on the initial question.
Project also gives the user the option of producing a "meme" by writing random statistics on to anime sign memes and then printing them to counsole. The original images are not included for copyright reasons, but can be found at their respective sources mentioned in the code.
